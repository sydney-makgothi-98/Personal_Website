                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>The problem was posed by the university, most students are always in a rush, late nights, ealry mornings as they say.
                    Breakfast tends be a hassle to prepare for the most part, and with buses to cath and so forth, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>
                    I was placed in a team of four and we were required to develop a robot that would self activate at 05h00, idenitify key food ingrendients based off colour
                    and position them so that the student/user would be able to start prepping their breakfast with immediate effect
                    upon entering the kitchen.

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>A self driving robot was developed in using and Arduino mirco-controller, using c++ as the primary language.
                Over 1000 lines of code were written.<br/><br/>
                The robot, lovingly named "Patrick-Star-Bot" was fitted with wall sensors so as to have wall follwing capabilities,
                and color sensors so that it would be able to differentiate between different coloured blocks which would be the "ingrendients".
                Needless to say the project was a success.

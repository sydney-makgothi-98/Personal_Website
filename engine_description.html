                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>Turbofan Engine Thrust at various altitudes is a pre-requisite in determining the performance of an aircraft. There are equations that can be used to calculate the thrust.
                    However most of them require published data such as mass flow rate. <br/><br/> Such inputs are not made avaible for the public in most cases. Preventing manufactuerers from
                    being able to gauage efficient their engines are and hence how well they are performing against their competition.

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p> A module was developed as a single python class that
                estimates the engine thrust of a commerical turbofan engine based purely on the BPR (Bypass Ratio) of said engine. <br/><br/> With a single click, thrust curves at several altitudes up to 
                41000 ft are generated. This was done for an Embraerer E-190. However the curves will vary depening on the inputs of the python class. This module estimates engine thrust
                with an error margin of less than 2%

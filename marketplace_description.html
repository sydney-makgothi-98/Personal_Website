                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>We live in a digital age in which we can contact each other,
                    friends, family, loved one's etc. However there still exist marketplaces where
                    people meet sell and purchase goods at afforable prices.<br/><br/>
                    The main problem here is that people most sellers in these congested areas
                    have to commute long distances with large hauls of produce, clothing etc. 
                    Without the guarentee 
                    that any of their products will be sold. There are marketplace apps that have already been
                    developed such as Shopify and Shein. However they require exuberant monthly fees for registration,
                    up to $2300.

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>A marketplace app was developed for the sole purpose helping lower working class
                citizines integrate seemlessly, at virtually no cost into the digital world.<br/><br/>
                The app allows for users to register, and list the goods they have available
                for sale. Integrated with live message sending capabilities, buyers and sellers
                can contact one other directly, and negotiate with one another in the comfort of their own
                homes.

            <h1>Hey there!</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Syd, a 25-year-old Full-stack dev with a background in Aerospace Engineering from the breathtaking mountains of Lesotho. When I’m not immersed in tech and design, I enjoy boxing, fencing, and building robots with Arduino. <br/><br/>

                I'm an anime fan (Hunter X Hunter is a favorite!) and love alternative hip-hop, especially Jessenashe, Earl Sweatshirt, and MIKE. As a gamer and sports enthusiast, I enjoy Life is Strange: True Colors, F1, UFC, and cheering for the Indiana Pacers.
